# saitama_kernel
Android 14 kernel or Oneplus 6/T with KSU Backport from Rissu and SUSFS from simon punk and some root hiding cherry picks. Made with Terminator-J's sources.

Use this manager: https://github.com/rsuntk/KernelSU/releases/

Recommended SUSFS module: https://github.com/sidex15/ksu_module_susfs (read its README carefully as it isn't compatible with other root hiding solutions and may require tweaking)
